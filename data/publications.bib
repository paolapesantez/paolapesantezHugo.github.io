	abstract = {Methods to efficiently uncover and extract community structures are required in a number of biological applications where networked data and their interactions can be modeled as graphs, and observing tightly-knit groups of vertices (“communities”) can offer insights into the structural and functional building blocks of the underlying network. Classical applications of community detection have largely focused on unipartite networks - i.e., graphs built out of a single type of objects. However, due to increased availability of biological data from various sources, there is now an increasing need for handling heterogeneous networks which are built out of multiple types of objects. In this paper, we address the problem of identifying communities from biological bipartite networks - i.e., networks where interactions are observed between two different types of objects (e.g., genes and diseases, drugs and protein complexes, plants and pollinators, and hosts and pathogens). Toward detecting communities in such bipartite networks, we make the following contributions: i) (metric) we propose a variant of bipartite modularity; ii) (algorithms) we present an efficient algorithm called biLouvain that implements a set of heuristics toward fast and precise community detection in bipartite networks (https://github.com/paolapesantez/biLouvain); and iii) (experiments) we present a thorough experimental evaluation of our algorithm including comparison to other state-of-the-art methods to identify communities in bipartite networks. Experimental results show that our biLouvain algorithm identifies communities that have a comparable or better quality (as measured by bipartite modularity) than existing methods, while significantly reducing the time-to-solution between one and four orders of magnitude.},

	abstract = {Virtual assistants are a growing area of research in academia and industry, with an impact on people’s daily lives. Many disciplines in science are moving towards the incorporation of intelligent virtual assistants in multiple scenarios and application domains, and GIScience is not external to this trend since they may be connected to intelligent spatial decision support systems. This article presents a scoping review to indicate relevant literature pertinent to intelligent virtual assistants and their usage of geospatial information and technologies. In particular, the study was designed to find critical aspects of GIScience and how to contribute to the development of virtual assistants. Moreover, this work explores the most prominent research lines as well as relevant technologies/platforms to determine the main challenges and current limitations regarding the use and implementation of virtual assistants in geospatial-related fields. As a result, this review shows the current state of geospatial applications regarding the use of intelligent virtual assistants, as well as revealing gaps and limitations in the use of spatial methods, standards, and resources available in spatial data infrastructures to develop intelligent decision systems based on virtual assistants for a wide array of application domains.},

Consequently, characteristics such as availability, scalability, interoperability, and failure handling have become essential. Due to the vast diversity of applications and user levels, and the growing complexity of data types and models handling geospatial data, information management has developed into a complex, often overlooked task, leading to delayed results and/or disorganization of information. The goal of this paper is to propose a software architecture design to support mobility data collection, analysis, and visualization. The proposal is based on the process for software architectures stated by Bredemeyer Consulting, comprising five stages: commit, requirements, design, validation, and deployment. Likewise, the Attribute Driven Design (ADD) method has been used for the design stage where the selected architectural pattern was Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) since it provides the scalability and interoperability attributes required for this study. The Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) has been chosen to identify the risks of the proposal and to evaluate the architecture to ensure that all requirements have been satisfactorily met. The model was validated using the data and projects of the LlactaLAB research group.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of technology has meant that over the past two decades Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) become increasingly involved in the teaching process and seek to change traditional learning models. With the support of modern technology, virtual platforms that encourage the adoption of a new learning paradigm in which geographical/temporal limitations no longer pose a difficulty have been developed and refined. These virtual learning platforms, also known as Learning Management Systems (LMS), store student and teacher interactions with course resources, and these interactions are stored in database engines. However, all the information generated by LMS has not been processed in a way that is helpful for the use of teachers and students, mainly because in most cases, students' interactions with these systems focus on downloading class material, delivering assignments, and reading announcements, leaving aside indicators that can be presented in the form of visualizations that allow actions to be taken during the development of the learning process. Thus, this study proposes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a dashboard for the analysis of learner behavior and prediction of dropout on the Moodle platform. The proposed tool will help students to manage their learning process, easily and effectively monitor their progress in an online course, and teachers to know what students do before, during and after a virtual class. The latter for the purpose of being able to detect early students at risk of dropping out.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) represents the new industrial revolution, in which physical and virtual objects are interconnected. On the other hand, microservices architectures have broken the monolithic and centralized way to build software, and provide systems with high-quality characteristics (e.g., resilience, availability, modularity, and portability). Therefore, the idea of merging those technologies can constitute a powerful strategy to be applied in environments that demand the distribution and management of many IoT devices using high-quality software. In this context, several studies that integrate IoT with microservices solutions have been analyzed. However, most of these studies aim to satisfy the functional requirements related to software and hardware, without taking into account software engineering methodologies and good practices that allow the creation of software for IoT devices considering their distributed nature. Thus, this paper presents the first approach to an agile methodology that i) contemplates the main characteristics of the IoT and ii) guides the development of appropriate software solutions based on microservices architectures to manage IoT environments acknowledging the serious difficulties that microservices imply.},

Guidance on how to coordinate the interaction between the LA policymaking and implementation is mostly missing, leaving a difficult challenge up to practitioners. In this study we propose a coordination model to support future LA initiatives at scale. We explore the problem by comparing two cases in Belgium and Ecuador. Following up we use the LA implementation timeline as a driver for planning the interaction between the policymaking and implementation. We continue by testing an application of the model with LA experts predominantly from Latin-American institutions, asking them to map low-level items of the SHEILA policy framework to four implementation phases. The results of this mapping support that LA policy building can be spread over time, that it can coincide with LA implementation at scale, and that both efforts can be coordinated. It is hoped that this study will provide additional guidance for future Latin-American and other LA initiatives.},

It differs from a traditional link prediction task in that the links in a knowledge graph are categorized into different predicates and the link prediction performance of different predicates in a knowledge graph generally varies widely. In this work, we propose a latent feature embedding based link prediction model which considers the prediction task for each predicate disjointly. To learn the model parameters it utilizes a Bayesian personalized ranking based optimization technique. Experimental results on large-scale knowledge bases such as YAGO2 show that our link prediction approach achieves substantially higher performance than several state-of-art approaches. We also show that for a given predicate the topological properties of the knowledge graph induced by the given predicate edges are key indicators of the link prediction performance of that predicate in the knowledge graph.},

	abstract = {Cold temperatures during fall and spring have the potential to cause frost damage to grapevines and other fruit plants, which can significantly decrease harvest yields. To help prevent these losses, farmers deploy expensive frost mitigation measures, such as, sprinklers, heaters, and wind machines, when they judge that damage may occur. This judgment, however, is challenging because the cold hardiness of plants changes throughout the dormancy period and it is difficult to directly measure. This has led scientists to develop cold hardiness prediction models that can be tuned to different grape cultivars based on laborious field measurement data. In this paper, we study whether deep-learning models can improve cold hardiness prediction for grapes based on data that has been collected over a 30-year time period. A key challenge is that the amount of data per cultivar is highly variable, with some cultivars having only a small amount. For this purpose, we investigate the use of multi-task learning to leverage data across cultivars in order to improve prediction performance for individual cultivars. We evaluate a number of multi-task learning approaches and show that the highest performing approach is able to significantly improve over learning for single cultivars and outperforms the current state-of-the-art scientific model for most cultivars.},
