 abstract = {Learning Analytics (LA) enables leaders to improve teaching, learning, organizational efficiency, and decision making. Nonetheless, LA initiatives often have difficulty to move out of prototype into real educational practice. As an emerging multidisciplinary field, we wonder how much its challenges are similar to other more mature related fields. This work assesses to which extent its risks are related to another well-established field as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) projects. Our findings show that risk factors and categories in ERP apply to LA projects and their top risks are considered very similar by LA experts. Therefore this work can help the LA community in the search for strategies to sustainable adoption.},
