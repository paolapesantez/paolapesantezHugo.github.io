 abstract = {Classical bipartite community methods only take into account inter-type edge information-i.e., edges between vertices of two different types. We present a new form of bipartite modularity (as an objective function for community detection) that can enable methods to incorporate both intra-type and inter-type edge information. Preliminary results evaluating this new form are presented.},
