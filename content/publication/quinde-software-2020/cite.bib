 abstract = {Over time Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have evolved from monolithic software to dynamic platforms interacting with other systems. Consequently, characteristics such as availability, scalability, interoperability, and failure handling have become essential. Due to the vast diversity of applications and user levels, and the growing complexity of data types and models handling geospatial data, information management has developed into a complex, often overlooked task, leading to delayed results and/or disorganization of information. The goal of this paper is to propose a software architecture design to support mobility data collection, analysis, and visualization. The proposal is based on the process for software architectures stated by Bredemeyer Consulting, comprising five stages: commit, requirements, design, validation, and deployment. Likewise, the Attribute Driven Design (ADD) method has been used for the design stage where the selected architectural pattern was Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) since it provides the scalability and interoperability attributes required for this study. The Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) has been chosen to identify the risks of the proposal and to evaluate the architecture to ensure that all requirements have been satisfactorily met. The model was validated using the data and projects of the LlactaLAB research group.},
